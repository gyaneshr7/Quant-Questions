        "theory":"Mensuration 2D is an important topic in Quantitative Aptitude, which mainly deals with problems related to the perimeter and area of two-dimensional shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, parallelograms, etc. In Quantitative Aptitude, this topic does not have many variations and most of the questions are based on certain fixed formulas. The ability to quickly and accurately calculate the area and perimeter of 2D shapes is an essential skill required for various competitive exams, including aptitude tests. It is therefore important for candidates to have a good understanding of 2D mensuration concepts and be able to apply them to solve problems",
